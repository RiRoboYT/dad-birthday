<p class="aarya">Dear Dad,

    On this special day, I want to take a moment to express just how much you mean to me. You've been my guiding light, my source of strength, and my unwavering support. Your love and wisdom have shaped me into the person I am today, and I am endlessly grateful for that. Your birthday is not just a celebration of another year but a reminder of the incredible person you are. May this day be filled with joy, laughter, and all the happiness you deserve. Happy Birthday, Dad! I love you more than words can express.
    
    With love and warmest wishes,
    [Aarya Maiti...]</p>
